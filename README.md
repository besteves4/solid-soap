# SOPE - Solid ODRL access control Policies Editor

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Web app generated with [`Inrupt's demo template`](https://github.com/inrupt/template-web-demo).

## Getting Started

First install, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. To change the
port from the default of 3000, use the `-p` option on the `dev` script in your `package.json`, for
example to change our app to use port 3001 instead:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3001",
    :
  },
  :
}
```
